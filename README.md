# darkburn_terminal

darkburn_terminal is a terminal colour scheme inspired, and intending to complement the darkburn colour scheme for vim.

Currently supports the konsole terminal emulator, and untested for other terminal emulators.

## Installation

* Konsole:
  
  * To install for the konsole terminal emulator, first copy the file `darkburn.colorscheme` to the directory `~/.local/share/konsole`.
  * You can then change your current colour scheme (I suggest creating a separate profile) by selecting `Settings -> Edit Current Profile... -> Appearance -> Colour scheme & font` and scrolling until you find `darkburn`.
  * Select it and the colour scheme should change.
